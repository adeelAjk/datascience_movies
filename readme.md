# Analyzing movies with python pandas

## Description
I created this project to play with movies' data. I used pandas, matplot and seaborn to analyze movies' ratings and other info.

## How to run
I used Google Colaboratory (https://colab.research.google.com) as the notebook, but you can use any notebook you want to.

## Data sets
You can download the datasets from kaggle and movielens:
